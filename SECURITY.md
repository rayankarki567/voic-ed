## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Student E-Governance System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [security@yourorganization.edu](mailto:security@yourorganization.edu)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge your email within **48 hours**
- We will provide a detailed response within **7 days** indicating the next steps
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the issue
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

### Disclosure Policy

- We ask that you give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue before making any information public
- We will coordinate with you on the timing of disclosure
- We believe in responsible disclosure and will credit you for your findings (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

Our application implements several security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0** with Google for secure authentication
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in Supabase
- **JWT tokens** with proper expiration
- **Session management** with secure cookies

### Data Protection
- **Input validation** on both client and server side
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** through proper data sanitization
- **CSRF protection** with secure tokens

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production
- **Secure headers** implementation
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Environment variable protection**

### Database Security
- **Database encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Access controls** with minimal required permissions
- **Audit logging** of sensitive operations
- **Regular backups** with encryption

## Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly review user permissions and access logs
- Keep the system updated with latest security patches

### For Students
- Use institutional email addresses for registration
- Don't share account credentials
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Log out from shared computers

## Vulnerability Response

When we receive a security vulnerability report:

1. **Immediate Assessment**: We evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Patch Development**: Our team develops and tests a fix
3. **Security Release**: We release a patch as quickly as possible
4. **Public Disclosure**: We coordinate disclosure with the reporter
5. **Post-Incident Review**: We analyze the incident to prevent similar issues

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and patched. Users will be notified through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Email notifications (for critical vulnerabilities)

## Contact Information

For any security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: security@yourorganization.edu
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours

## Legal Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruption to others
- Only interact with accounts they own or with explicit permission
- Do not access or modify data belonging to other users
- Contact us first before disclosing any vulnerabilities publicly
- Give us reasonable time to address issues before any disclosure

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.

Thank you for helping keep our Student E-Governance System secure!
