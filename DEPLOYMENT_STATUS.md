# Deployment Status Dashboard

## Quick Deploy Commands
```bash
# Full deployment with checks
npm run pre-deploy && npm run deploy

# Preview deployment  
npm run deploy:preview

# Health check after deployment
npm run health-check
```

## Current Status
- ✅ API Routes: 14/14 configured with Vercel runtime
- ✅ Build: Production ready
- ✅ Environment: Variables configured
- ✅ Security: Headers and policies implemented
- ✅ Documentation: Complete

## Vercel Error Prevention

### Common Issues Resolved:
1. **FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT** ✅
   - All API routes have `maxDuration = 30`
   - Runtime set to `nodejs18`

2. **EDGE_RUNTIME_UNSUPPORTED_API** ✅
   - All routes use Node.js runtime
   - Dynamic rendering configured

3. **PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE** ✅
   - Request size validation implemented
   - Response pagination configured

## Monitoring Setup

### After Deployment:
1. Run health check: `npm run health-check`
2. Monitor Vercel Function logs
3. Check Core Web Vitals in Vercel dashboard
4. Set up error alerts in Vercel settings

### Performance Targets:
- API Response: < 1000ms ✅
- Page Load: < 2000ms 
- Build Time: < 3 minutes

## Emergency Procedures

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Run `npm run check` locally
4. Use Vercel's rollback feature

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel: `npm run deploy`
2. Configure custom domain (optional)
3. Set up monitoring alerts
4. Performance optimization review
